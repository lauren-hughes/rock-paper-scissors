# rock-paper-scissors
This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). It involved creating a first to five rock, paper, scissors simulation against the computer. The player can select rock, paper or scissors using the (very plain) user interface. The results of each round are displayed, as well as the running scores of both the player and the computer. Once either the player or computer reach five points, the overall winner is displayed and a play again button appears. This button resets the game. The project serves as a brief demonstration of some JavaScript skills.
